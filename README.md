# Simon-Game
The game consists of a circular console with four colored buttons - red, green, blue, and yellow - and a built-in speaker.

The game randomly generates a sequence of colors, lighting up the corresponding buttons, and players must repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the correct order. The game starts with a simple sequence of only one color, and as the player progresses, the sequence becomes longer and more complex.
